	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b><u> Wolf of the wall street (2013)  </u> :- </b> </p>
	<img src="H:\CSS Advance\Portfolio\Assets\Image\WOTW.jpg" alt="Wolf of the wall Street">
	<p><b>About this Movie :- </b> </p>
	<p>The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American epic biographical black comedy crime film co-produced and directed by
	Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir of the same name.
	It recounts Belfort's career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in 
	rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, leading to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also a producer of 
	the film, stars as Belfort in his fifth collaboration with Scorsese following Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), 
	The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010). The film also stars Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie 
	Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham. </p>

	<p>The film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, 
	by Paramount Pictures. It was the first major American film to be released exclusively through digital distribution.[3] It was a major commercial success, grossing $406.9 million worldwide during its theatrical run, becoming Scorsese's highest-grossing film.[4] The film was controversial for its moral ambiguity and lack of sympathy for victims, as well as explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use, and use of animals during production. It set a Guinness World Record for the most instances of swearing in a film. The film's financing became implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption scandal; the U.S. Department of 
	Justice and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission investigated Red Granite Pictures, and producer Riza Aziz was arrested in 2019.
	The film received positive reviews (and some moral censure) from critics and appeared on several "best of the year" lists. It was nominated for several awards, including five at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (for DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (for Hill). DiCaprio won Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 
	71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. </p>

	

	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b><u> The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  </u> :- </b> </p>
	<img src="H:\CSS Advance\Portfolio\Assets\Image\SR.jpg" alt="The Shawshank Redemption">
	<p><b> About this Movie :- </b></p>
	<p> The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American prison drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton).
	William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.</p>

	<p>Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy,
	including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.</p>

	<p>While The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman's score, Darabont's direction and screenplay and the cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy 
	Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.</p>

	<p>Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most "beloved" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of 
	Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". </p>
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b><u> Fight Club (1999)  </u> :- </b> </p>
	<img src="H:\CSS Advance\Portfolio\Assets\Image\FClub.jpg" alt="Fight Club ">
	<p><b> About this Movie :- </b></p>
	
	<p>"Fight Club," directed by David Fincher and released in 1999, is a gripping cinematic experience that delves deep into the human psyche and challenges societal conventions. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film follows the journey of an insomniac and disillusioned office worker (Edward Norton), who forms an underground fight club with the charismatic and anarchic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). This secret club evolves into a chaotic movement that seeks to dismantle consumerism, conformity, and the suffocating norms of contemporary society.</p>

	<p>The film's visual style is gritty and dark, echoing the characters' inner struggles and the unsettling themes it explores. Edward Norton delivers a captivating performance as the troubled protagonist, while Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler Durden exudes charismatic rebellion. Helena Bonham Carter adds complexity to the narrative as Marla Singer, a fellow disrupter of the status quo.</p>

	<p>"Fight Club" is known for its iconic and provocative lines, including "The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club." This secrecy serves as a metaphor for the film's deeper layers of commentary on the human desire for connection, validation, and purpose.</P>

	<p>The movie's exploration of identity, masculinity, mental health, and the consequences of unchecked capitalism challenges viewers to question their own beliefs and societal constructs. As the unreliable narrative unfolds, the audience is invited to question the blurred lines between reality and the protagonist's fractured perspective.</P>

	<P>"Fight Club" remains a relevant cultural touchstone, sparking conversations about the impact of consumerism, toxic masculinity, and the yearning for authenticity in a world dominated by appearances. Its enduring legacy lies in its ability to both captivate and unsettle, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema and inviting viewers to contemplate the tumultuous complexities of the human experience.</P>
